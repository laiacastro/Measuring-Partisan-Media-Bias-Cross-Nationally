# Measuring-Partisan-Media-Bias-Cross-Nationally
This repository contains 4 files associated with my paper "Measuring Partisan Media Bias Cross-Nationally" forthcoming in the Swiss Political Science Review. Find in <a href="url">here</a> a link to the abstract and in here the online appendix including detailed computation of the measures presented in the paper, variable coding and some visualizations of how measures can be applied to measure partisan bias at different levels of analysis (media outlet-party, media outlet, party and country). This file contains partisan media bias scores at the four levels of analysis abovementioned.
